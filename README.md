###  [Tkinter-based vehicle monitoring application](https://github.com/Mostafa-Awaad/CANSocket_Implementation/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#tkinter-based-vehicle-monitoring-application)  
- **Description:** The Tkinter-based vehicle monitoring application is a vehicle monitoring solution designed using Python for the user interface and for backend data processing. It provides an interactive dashboard that streams various car signals using dynamic gauges for each signal. 
- **Tech Stack:**  Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, CAN DBC
- **Features:**  
     - Fetches vehicle speed, engine coolant temp, battery SOH, and other data from the Flask server.
     - Updates the GUI asynchronously. 
     - Updates speed, engine coolant temp, battery SOH, and other signals and their descriptive images based on fetched data.
     - Processes a DBC (Database CAN) file to decode CAN messages.
     - Converts the DBC data into an ASC (ASCII log) file based on generated random data (100 values for each signal).

###  [CAN Socket Implementation with Scapy and python-can](https://github.com/Mostafa-Awaad/CANSocket_Implementation/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#can-socket-implementation-with-scapy-and-python-can)  
- **Description:** integrates Scapy with python-can to simulate a virtual CAN (Controller Area Network) environment. The script demonstrates how to create virtual CAN interfaces, sniff CAN FD (Flexible Data-rate) frames, and send CAN FD packets with extended identifiers using virtual CAN sockets.
- **Tech Stack:**  Python, CAN FD, CAN-Socket, Linux
- **Features:**  
     - Virtual CAN Interface Setup: Automatically creates virtual CAN interfaces (vcan0 and vcan1).
     - CAN FD Frame Sniffing: Utilizes Scapy's AsyncSniffer to capture CAN FD frames with data lengths greater than 8 bytes.
     - CAN FD Frame Sending: Sends a CAN FD extended frame from vcan0.
     - Multithreading: Runs sniffing and sending processes in parallel using Python's threading module.

###  [Graduation project](https://github.com/Mostafa-Awaad/Graduation-Project)  
- **Description:** EEG-based exoskeleton arm for rehabilitation.
- **Tech Stack:**  Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, MNE, scikit-learn, MATLAB Engine API, SciPy
- **Features:**  
     - We developed a machine learning model, in which we used
          - Machine learning frameworks: (TensorFlow and Keras).
          - PythonVisualization Libraries: (Matplotlib and MNE).
          - Pandas Library for data manipulation.
          - Scikit-learn library for data classification anf statistical modelling.
          - MATLAB Engine API for Python.
          - SciPy Library for scientific computing and technical computing to classify patients‚Äô intentions and make predictions for the servo motor of the exoskeleton arm that we designed to move based on offlinedataset.
     - We then made the model trained.
     - Using the trained model, we were able to record online dataset using UNICORN HYBRID BLACK headset and classify the patients‚Äô intentions to make predictions for the intended motion using Lab Streaming Layer
communication protocol and mapping these intentions to near real-time movement for the exoskeleton arm.
